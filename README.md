🔍 Analysis Framework
Data Analysis Pillars
1. Branch Profitability Analysis
Using Excel formulas and pivot tables to calculate:
Profit Margin = (Revenue - Total Costs) / Revenue × 100
Cost-to-Revenue Ratio = Total Operating Costs / Total Revenue
```
- Regional comparison using **Pivot Tables**
- Branch-level outlier identification with **Conditional Formatting**
- Benchmark isolation using **Statistical Functions** (AVERAGE, PERCENTILE)

#### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
Multi-dimensional analysis across:
- **Age Groups**: Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z
- **Income Tiers**: Basic, Standard, Premium
- **Account Types**: Savings, Checking, Credit Cards, Loans
- **Techniques Used**: COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, Pivot Tables with slicers

#### 3. **Trend Analysis**
YoY performance tracking:
```
YoY Growth % = ((Current Year Value - Prior Year Value) / Prior Year Value) × 100
```
- Transaction value trends using **Time Series Analysis**
- Customer acquisition patterns via **Growth Rate Calculations**
- Revenue momentum tracking with **Moving Averages**

#### 4. **Service Quality Metrics**
Complaint analysis framework:
- Volume by product category (**Pivot Tables**)
- Issue type classification (**VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP**)
- Correlation analysis between complaints and profitability
